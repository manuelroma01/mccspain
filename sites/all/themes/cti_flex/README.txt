INSTALLATION:

Before you enable this theme, you must have the Zen theme installed in the same theme directory, but it doesn't need to be enabled.

TIPS FOR USING THIS THEME

Suckerfish menus:
Suckerfish dropdown menus are incorporated into main navigation bar. To use this feature, set up your Primary links menu so that the menu items have children and the parent items have the �expanded� option selected.

Creating a custom color scheme:
To create your own custom color scheme, on the theme configuration page select "None" under the
"Design" category. Then enter HTML color codes into the various fields of the "Custom color settings" section to set colors for different page elements. If you have the Color Picker module installed and enabled, you can use the javascript color selection widgets in this configuration section.

You may also use the custom color settings in conjunction with the predesigned color schemes, but there may be some incompatibilities. Also, to switch from a custom color scheme to one of the predesigned colors schemes, you should clear out all the custom color fields before saving the configuration.

NEW RELEASE: 6.x-2.x

The 6.x-2.x series of this theme is compatible with the 6.x-2.x versions of Zen. The 1.x series of this theme only works with the 6.x-1.x series of Zen.
Notes about upgrading:

The 6.x-2.x series is a major overhaul of the theme, incorporating many updates in the latest Zen series (6.x-2.x), including new and renamed block regions, classes, and ids, updated stylesheet organization and a modified directory structure. As a result, if you have customized the theme, you may find that your code will need some updating before an upgrade.

Also before upgrading, you should record any custom color settings you are using as those options have been reorganized and expanded. If you do not wish to upgrade, I will continue to do bug fixes (but not new features) on the 6.x-1.x series and it will be available as long as the compatible Zen version is.

IE STYLESHEET LIMIT REMINDER

As there are more stylesheets in the theme now, there is a greater likelihood of exceeding the 30 stylesheet limit in IE. When using the theme on production sites, be sure to enable the Optimize CSS Files option at /admin/settings/performance.
